# 🛒 E-Commerce Microservices Architecture

## 🏗️ Overview

This project implements a scalable microservices-based architecture for an e-commerce platform. I'm Using **Spring Cloud** technologies for service discovery, configuration management, and inter-service communication. The microservices architecture is designed to be extensible and prepared for future enhancements like fault tolerance and advanced database communication strategies.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. 🔍 **Service Discovery**  
   - **Eureka Server**: Acts as the central service registry for dynamically discovering and registering microservices.
   - All microservices are configured as Eureka clients.

### 2. 🛠️ **Centralized Configuration**  
   - **Spring Cloud Config Server**: Provides centralized management of application configurations.  
   - Hosted configuration files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/SefyanKehail/config-ecom-app).  

### 3. 🌐 **API Gateway**  
   - **Spring Cloud Gateway**: Serves as the dynamic routing and load-balancing gateway for external requests.

### 4. 🔗 **Inter-Service Communication**  
   - **OpenFeign**: Simplifies RESTful inter-service communication with other microservices.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### 1. 📦 **Containerization**  
   - Microservices will be **Dockerized** to enable seamless deployment and scaling across multiple environments.  

### 2. 🛡️ **Fault Tolerance**  
   - Integration with **Resilience4J** to introduce fault tolerance mechanisms like circuit breakers, retries, and rate limiting.  

### 3. 🗃️ **Distributed Data Architecture**  
   - Adoption of **Event Sourcing** and **CQRS** patterns to improve consistency, scalability, and performance of database communication.

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions  
1. 🚀 Start the Eureka server to enable service registration and discovery.  
2. 📂 Start the Config server to allow microservices to pull their configuration.  
3. 🔧 Launch each microservice and keep the gateway microservice the last.  
4. 🌍 Run the Gateway server to handle external requests.
